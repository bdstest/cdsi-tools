## 🎯 Overview

CDSI is an enterprise-grade compliance analysis platform that provides intelligent, contextual recommendations while maintaining complete customer anonymization. The platform features session-aware tracking, tiered analysis capabilities, and privacy-by-design architecture.

### 🔒 **Privacy-First Architecture**
- **Zero PII Storage**: All customer data anonymized before processing
- **Session-Based Tracking**: Contextual recommendations without identity exposure
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Complete anonymization with business intelligence
- **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and privacy-law ready

### 🧠 **Intelligent Features**
- **Contextual Recommendations**: Intelligent suggestions based on interaction patterns
- **Tiered Analysis**: Progressive feature unlocking (🌱→🌿→🪴→🌲→🌳)
- **Session Continuity**: Personalized experience across interactions
- **Implementation Tracking**: Progress monitoring with privacy protection

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Optional: Redis for session storage (fallback to in-memory)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cdsi-platform.git
cd cdsi-platform

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
python tests/basic_integration_test.py

# Start API server
python src/api/session_aware_api.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.core.session_manager import AnonymizedSessionManager
from src.core.contextual_recommendations import ContextualRecommendationEngine

# Initialize systems
session_manager = AnonymizedSessionManager()
recommendation_engine = ContextualRecommendationEngine()

# Create customer session (data automatically anonymized)
session = session_manager.create_session(
    "customer@business.com",  # Gets hashed to customer_abc123
    {
        'website_url': 'https://business.com',  # Gets anonymized to site_xyz789.example
        'tier_level': 'aware'
    }
)

# Generate contextual recommendations
recommendations = recommendation_engine.generate_recommendations_for_session(
    session.session_id,
    session_manager,
    max_recommendations=3
)

print(f"Session: {session.customer_hash}")  # customer_abc123
print(f"Recommendations: {len(recommendations)}")
```

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### Anonymization Features
- **Real-time PII Detection**: Automatically identifies and anonymizes personal data
- **Consistent Hashing**: Same customer = same anonymous identifier across sessions
- **Generic Categorization**: Business intelligence without identity exposure
- **Zero Data Breach Risk**: No PII to compromise

### Example Anonymization
```python
# Input (gets anonymized immediately)
customer_email = "john@mybusiness.com"
website_url = "https://mybusiness.com"

# Stored anonymously as:
customer_hash = "customer_a1b2c3d4"
anonymized_url = "https://site_e5f6g7h8.example"
customer_segment = "professional_services"  # Generic category
```

## 🧠 Contextual Recommendations

### Intelligent Context Awareness
- **Interaction History**: Learns from customer behavior patterns
- **Implementation Style**: Detects preference for progressive vs immediate changes
- **Business Segment**: Tailors recommendations to business type
- **Compliance Gaps**: Prioritizes based on risk and impact

### Example Recommendations
```python
# Low compliance score (5.0/10) generates:
[
    {
        "title": "Create Comprehensive Privacy Policy",
        "priority": "high", 
        "estimated_impact": "+3.0 points",
        "implementation_time": "3-5 days",
        "context_relevance": "Privacy policy provides biggest improvement"
    },
    {
        "title": "Add Contact Form Privacy Notice", 
        "priority": "high",
        "estimated_impact": "+2.5 points",
        "implementation_time": "1 day",
        "context_relevance": "Quick win with high impact"
    }
]
```
